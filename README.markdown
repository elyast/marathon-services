## Overview
This project allows you to utilize your Mesos cluster to run services like Cassandra, ElasticSearch of Kafka.
The scheduler will do all the heavy lifting like downloading package to the worker nodes, distributing the configuration and monitoring the instances. It will automatically modify configuration files to include the selected nodes running service as seed nodes through a template variable.

## Known Limitations

Currently the scheduler does not deal with cluster failure in an intelligent manner. These features will be added shortly once we gain some initial feedback.
